# PSI_Sensor
 Measuring PSI (Pounds per Square Inch) typically involves using a pressure sensor or gauge to measure the pressure of a fluid (usually air or gas) in a confined space. The specific Python code for PSI measurement would depend on the hardware you are using to capture the pressure data.

# **ABOUT THE CODE**
This [code](read_pressure_psi.py) uses the Adafruit CircuitPython library for the ADS1x15 ADC and assumes you have it installed ('pip install adafruit-circuitpython-ads1x15). Also, you need to connect the pressure sensor to the appropriate pins on your microcontroller. Make sure to refer to the datasheets of your pressure sensor and ADC for accurate calibration information and connection details. The code above is just a starting point, and it needs to be adapted to your specific hardware setup.
